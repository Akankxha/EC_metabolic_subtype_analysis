# Title
Identification and Characterization of Metabolic Subtypes of Endometrial Cancer using a Systems-Level Approach

# Abstract 
Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynaecological cancer worldwide. Under-standing the metabolic adaptation and its heterogeneity in tumor tissues may provide new in-sights and help in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. In this study, we investigated metabolic alterations of EC to understand the variations in the metabolism within tumor sam-ples. We integrated the TCGA transcriptomics data of EC (RNA-Seq) with the human genome-scale metabolic model (HMR2.0) and performed unsupervised learning to identify the metabolic subtypes of EC and uncover the underlying dysregulated metabolic pathways and reporter me-tabolites in each subtype. The relationship between metabolic subtypes and clinical variables was explored. Further, we characterized each subtype at the molecular level and correlated the subtype-specific metabolic changes occurring at the transcriptome level with the genomic altera-tions. Based on metabolic profile, EC patients are stratified into two robust metabolic subtypes (metabolic subtype-1 and metabolic subtype-2) that significantly correlate to patient survival, tumor stages, mutation, and copy number variations. We observed co-activation of pentose phosphate pathway and one-carbon metabolism along with genes involved in controlling estro-gen levels in metabolic subtype-2, which is linked to poor survival. PNMT and ERBB2 are also upregulated in metabolic subtype-2 samples and present oin the same chromosome locus 17q12, which is amplified. PTEN and TP53 mutations show mutually exclusive behavior between sub-types and display a difference in survival. This work identifies metabolic subtypes with distinct characteristics at the transcriptome and genome levels, highlighting the metabolic heterogeneity within EC.
